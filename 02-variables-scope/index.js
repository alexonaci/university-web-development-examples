/*
* Hoisting
* Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation.
* This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code.
* However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.
* For variables declared with `var`, they are hoisted and initialized to `undefined`.
* For `let` and `const`, they are also hoisted but remain uninitialized until their declaration is encountered,
* leading to a "Temporal Dead Zone" error if accessed before declaration.
