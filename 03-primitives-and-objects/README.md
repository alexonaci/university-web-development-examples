**What you'll learn:** JavaScript data types and memory management

**Key concepts covered:**
- Primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol)
- Object types (objects, arrays, functions)
- Pass by value vs pass by reference
- Shallow vs deep copying

**Why this matters:** Understanding how JavaScript handles different data types is crucial for avoiding common bugs and writing efficient code.
